 Decision-Making Points
Segment Customers by Channel and Region
→ Create specialized marketing strategies based on customer type and location.

Focus on High-Spending Categories
→ Allocate more resources and campaigns toward categories with higher average spending.

Bundle Highly Correlated Products
→ Design combo offers (e.g., Grocery + Detergents) where strong correlations exist.

Target Low-Spending Segments
→ Use discounts and promotions to boost spending among low or zero-spend customers.

Prioritize Loyalty Programs for High Spenders
→ Identify top 10-20% of customers by total spend and design reward schemes.

Handle Outliers Separately
→ Outliers might need customized offers or separate analysis (VIP handling).

Simplify Reporting via Renamed Columns
→ Use standardized, clean column names for easier team understanding and reporting.

Detect Regional Preferences
→ Based on regional averages, promote regionally popular products more aggressively.

Predictive Modeling Readiness
→ Dataset is clean and correlated — good foundation to build spending prediction models.

Inventory Planning
→ Stock products based on overall average demand and correlation trends to reduce waste.
